# SmartSeed

This is an open source image editing software modeled after Adobe Photoshop.  I hope that I can use as many AI algorithms as possible to make it feature rich. Currently, this project is still in production, so stay tuned.

## Environment

- Python 3.x
- PyQt 5
- OpenCV 3.x

## Progress

### v 1.0

Currently, the functions that have been implemented are as follows:

- New artboard
